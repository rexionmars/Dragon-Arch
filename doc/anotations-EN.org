* How a computer starts up
** 1. BIOS is copied from a ROM
** 2. BIOS starts executing code
- initializes hardware
- runs some tests (POST -> Power-on self test)
** 3. BIOS searches for an operating system to start
** 4. BIOS loads and starts the operating system
** 5. Operating system runs

* How the BIOS finds an OS
** Legacy booting
- BIOS loads first sector of each bootable device into memory (at location 0x7C00)
- BIOS checks for 0xAA55 signature
- If found, it starts executing code

** EFI
- BIOS looks into special EFI partitions
- Operating System must be compiled as an EFI program


* Directive
 Gives a clue to the assembler that will affect how the program gets
 compiled. NOT translated to machine code!
 Assembler specific - different assemblers might have diffrent directives.

* Instruction
Translate to a machine code instruction that the CPU will execute.
